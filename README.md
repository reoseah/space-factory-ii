# Space Factory

Space Factory is a sci-fi mod for Minecraft. It focuses on futuristic atmosphere and power fantasy, with a bit of
automation and exploration thrown in.

It tries to recreate atmosphere of mods like IndustrialCraft2 with addons, GregTech, and likes,
and avoids the "realistic" and "gritty" present in TechReborn, IC2 Experimental, later GregTech.

It adds machines that look like lab equipment and work like magic,
futuristic equipment designed to make anything else obsolete and nonexistent materials to make it,
all with clean textures and over the top names.
