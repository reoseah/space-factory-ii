# Space Factory

Space Factory is a sci-fi mod for Minecraft. It focuses on futuristic atmosphere and power fantasy, with a bit of
automation and exploration thrown in.

It's inspired by mods like IndustrialCraft2 and GregTech, by the sci-fi style that emerges from machines looking like
lab equipment, energy flowing through glass fiber and energy crystals, electric equipment making non-electric
alternatives obsolete, and the general feeling of being a mad scientist. 

It's anti-inspired by elements of TechReborn, later GregTech, IC2 Experimental and likes, such as the dirty and gritty, no longer futuristic textures, diluting mod with low sci-fi and "realistic" elements, pushing advanced technology to the late endgame.
